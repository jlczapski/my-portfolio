		<h2 class="about-title"><span class="highlight">01. About me</span></h2>

			<p class="about-desc">I am a junior web developer, based in Nottingham, who is looking to break into the world of web development. I have been learning & progressing my development skills for almost 4 years, since starting my BSc (Hons) in Digital Media at the University of the West of England, in 2014. 
            <br><br>
			I mostly specialise in front-end development, but also have a great understanding of design theory, and how it can be utilised to produce highly effective websites & applications. With the ever-changing nature of web development, I recognise the importance of spending time researching new ways in which to streamline my development process, e.g. by using JS toolkits such as Gulp, or taking online courses in industry standard technologies (currently learning my way around Vue.js).
			<br><br>
			I believe that truly great design comes from cooperation & collaboration within teams of like-minded people, and I am currently searching for a company who can provide this type of environment. Having not long graduated, I am very keen to get started working in the industry. If you have space in your organisation for a highly self-motivated & passionate worker, then I would love to hear from you!

					<h4 class="project-title-1"><span class="highlight">Strafe Creative</span></h4>

					<p class="project-desc-1">This site was created as part of a design task for <a href="http://www.strafecreative.co.uk/" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Strafe Creative</span></a>, in Nottingham, leading up to an interview. The site was styled as portfolio website for a fictional company named 'ABC Company'. I was provided with a PSD document, and had to convert it to a fully responsive website with added animation & interactivity. This was done using a combination of HTML, CSS, Sass & JavaScript, alongside Materialize.css as the front-end framework.</p>

					<p class="project-desc-2">I was approached by <a href="http://www.henipublishing.com/" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Heni Publishing</span></a>, based in Soho, to create a website for a fictional artist named 'Karen Gabo', as part of a design task, with a view to having a face-to-face interview with the company. The site needed to promote the artist's various projects & styles, and fit the theme of the artwork that she produced. I built the site using a combination of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, using <a href="http://demos.creative-tim.com/get-shit-done/index.html" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">GSDKit</span></a> as a front-end framework (a user-made variation of Bootstrap).</p>
