# Portfolio

This is my personal web development & design portfolio, which has been built using HTML, CSS, Sass & JavaScript, run using Gulp & Git Version Control. 

This portfolio contains websites which I have built as part of design tasks for various companies (as pre-interview requisite), and goes into more detail about my experiences as a developer & designer. Please take a look around!
